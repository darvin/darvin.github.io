Played a little bit with [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). [coffee-express](https://github.com/twilson63/express-coffee) boilerplate was a good starting point. Made my very own fork with  [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) models - [express-coffee-mvc](https://github.com/darvin/express-coffee-mvc). 

Really nice sinatra-flask-style framework. Default [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templates are just awesome! For API-only applications without web part [restify](http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify/) feels like a better fit though thanks to compatibility of [connect-middleware](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/wiki) between different frameworks.

PS: just found the best web-framework for CoffeeScript: [Zappa](http://zappajs.org/). Just like it suppose to be in CoffeeScript!
