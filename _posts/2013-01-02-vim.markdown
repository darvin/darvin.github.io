I dropped **TextMate 2** and **Sublime Text 2** this week.
TextMate just felt a little bit obsolete and unsupported, and
I just hated Sublime Text's problems with the color output in 
the console (it was showing like `ESC` sequences - seriously, guys?)
Also, turns out there is no syntax coloring for both of
them for Forth language.

So, I'm back on VIM! With [Alloy's fork with drawer](https://github.com/alloy/macvim)
and [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) config. Looks awesome!
